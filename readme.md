1. Execution/Testing steps for TCP based server/client:
-------------------------------------------------------

	Change directory: cd PART_A_TCP_Based/src
	
	Remove all old class files: make clean
	Compile the code: make

	Sample execution steps for 3 servers:
	- Sample config file with 3 servers has been provided
	- START SERVER-1: Open a new terminal and type - sh start_server_at.sh 0
	- START SERVER-2: Open a new terminal and type - sh start_server_at.sh 1
	- START SERVER-3: Open a new terminal and type - sh start_server_at.sh 2

	Sample execution steps for multi-threaded client:
	- Sample config file with 3 servers has been provided
	- Run N (8) threads
	- START MULTI-THREADED CLIENT: Open a new terminal and then type - sh start_client_with_threads.sh 8

2. Names of LOG FILES generated by running the system:
------------------------------------------------------
	- CLIENT log file: TCPClientLogfile
	- SERVER-1 log file: TCPServerLogFile0
	- SERVER-2 log file: TCPServerLogFile2
	- SERVER-3 log file: TCPServerLogFile3

3. PERFORMANCE data for system sizes: (1, 3 and 5)
---------------------------------------------------

	When executed on a single host -

	Number of Servers	Num of Requests Per Server  Time taken to execute a single request
	-----------------   --------------------------  --------------------------------------
		1               800 (8 Threads * 100 Ops)    41
		3				800 (8 Threads * 100 Ops)	 48.67
		5				800 (8 Threads * 100 Ops)    73

	When executed on a multiple host -

	Number of Servers	Num of Requests Per Server  Time taken to execute a single request
	-----------------   --------------------------  --------------------------------------
		1               800 (8 Threads * 100 Ops)    38
		3				800 (8 Threads * 100 Ops)	 45.2
		5				800 (8 Threads * 100 Ops)    61.6

4. SCRIPT FILES:
----------------

	Script to compile the programs: makeFile
	Script to start server and client processes: start_server_at.sh AND start_client_with_threads.sh

*** Please note that the halt response format is <0 0 0 true> and will be at the end of TCPClientLogfile
